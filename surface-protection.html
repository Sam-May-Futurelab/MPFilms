                            <p class="product-description">Hullguard Premium is our flagship surface protection film, engineered for exceptional performance on both interior and exterior yacht surfaces. Made from high-quality white polyolefin, this film is available in two formats — MPF701 and MPF724 — and is ideal for protecting gelcoat and high-gloss finishes during construction, refits, or winter layup.</p>
                            <p>MPF701 is the only marine protection film we know of that's tested and approved for 12 months of UV resistance and weatherability, while MPF724 offers robust protection for up to 9 months. Both versions prevent oxidation, apply cleanly with no adhesive transfer, and remove without leaving residue.</p>
                            <p>Thanks to their impressive 600% elongation, Hullguard Premium films conform easily to complex hull, deck, and superstructure shapes — providing a reliable barrier that stretches and protects without compromise.</p>
