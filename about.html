                        <p>Dedicated to achieving the perfect harmony of sound and silence in the world of boat building, Marine Protective Films (MP Films) provides state-of-the-art finishing materials and technical solutions for the maritime industry. At KP Acoustics Group, our expert team has been fortunate to work closely with MP Films to support their clients' needs in achieving the perfect acoustic balance that seamlessly blends luxury with safety on a variety of marine vessels. To take a deeper look into life at MP Films, Richard King, Managing Director at MP Films shares insight into his role, the common problems the business solves for clients and what is on the horizon within the marine material industry.</p>
                        
                        <p>Alongside MP Films, the exclusive UK supplier of Nitto's leading Hexadamp noise and vibration reduction products, we're on a mission to provide our clients with comprehensive acoustic design, sound insulation investigations, noise at work assessments, noise impact assessments and more. We spoke to the driving force behind MP Films to give you the inside scoop on their journey so far.</p>
                        
                        <h3>1. Can you tell us about your background?</h3>
                        <p>With over 50 years of experience at director level in a variety of materials industries and specialising in new product developments, I have always been interested in innovative products and their suitable application. I have had an active business relationship with Nitto for over 30 years, which is about the same amount of time that I've owned a boat of one type or another, from hydroplanes to luxury motor cruisers.</p>
                        
                        <p>With a keen interest in the field both professionally and personally, I began to appreciate the noise and vibration-dampening needs of other boat owners, especially those with more luxurious and expensive crafts where guests and crew often sleep on board - making a sound night's sleep a MUST! In tandem with this, health and safety standards have improved across the world in recent years, meaning that even operators of commercial shipping must now ensure the noise levels on board do not adversely affect the safe operations of the crew.</p>
                        
                        <p>By linking the innovative noise and vibration and surface protection products produced by Nitto in Japan and Belgium for use in aerospace and automotive industries, it seemed logical to me to marry that expertise with the marine industry, leading to the birth of Marine Protective Films around three years ago.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. What do you love most about what you do?</h3>
                        <p>For several years, the pull of the ocean has had an effect on me, so the opportunity to start a company in this industry piqued my interest immensely. It's a great opportunity to bring technical expertise and solutions to what has historically been a very conservative industry that more commonly uses traditional ways to solve problems, because "it's always been like that". The constant innovation and development of noise and vibration-dampening materials with our manufacturing partners, such as Nitto, enables us to address our clients' problems and supply solutions for the benefit of all.</p>
                        
                        <h3>3. What problems does your business solve?</h3>
                        <p>We work collaboratively with our clients and partners to identify specific materials that address a market problem or challenge. At this time, we are particularly involved in addressing the noise and vibration problems in commercial marine working conditions, the improvement of noise and vibration management in Superyachts and leisure craft, as well as the surface protection of all exposed areas on a vessel during its build and/or refit.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our biggest, perhaps most exciting challenge this year has been the development of Nitto's new NVH materials for marine applications. Working to carefully adjust well-tested materials in the automotive and aerospace industries to suit our needs in the maritime sector. Another challenge we are looking to solve in the near future is the cost-effective protection of the leading edge of wind turbines, evaluating several new constructs to provide the necessary technical characteristics required. An exciting new endeavour.</p>
                        
                        <h3>4. What's on the horizon this year for your business?</h3>
                        <p>At MP Films, we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our development programmes, whilst expanding our commercial base. Although we have gained significant experience and expertise over the years, our company is still relatively new. Our objective now is to work with a base of new clients wishing to use the products and solutions we can offer to improve the working practices they employ when building, or re-fitting, a marine vessel.</p>
                        
                        <p>New developments we expect to see emerging include the introduction of more renewable and recyclable marine material within our supply chain that do not compromise the efficiency of specifications. Again, with Nitto leading in this field, we are confident that the marine industry can, and will, achieve its health and safety and environmental objectives over the years to come.</p>
                        
                        <h3>5. Why are acoustics important to your business?</h3>
                        <p>The science of acoustics is a 20th-century science, and we're only now understanding how it can affect the efficiency of our day-to-day lives - both at work and in leisure. KP Acoustics Group are the major independent research and analytical company in the UK concerned with noise and vibration analysis, its cause and effects. Their new state-of-the-art facility in Southampton demonstrates their commitment to authenticity and independence, which enables us to work with them in the knowledge that their results and reports will help us to introduce solutions in both the industrial and leisure markets of the marine industry. Combining our strengths at MP Films with those of KP Acoustics has given me every confidence in our future success.</p>
